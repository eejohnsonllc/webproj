    projctdescription: "We were hired by the Carolina Across 100 Initiative out of the UNC School of Government to analyze survey data that asked respondents from all across the state about the effect of COVID-19 on their organizations and communities. Using a suite of data analytics tools, we were able to identify common areas of concern and trends in expectations about recovery from the pandemic. We then created visualizations to present these trends to the initiative's stakeholders, to inform their decisions about how the university can help communities across the state. The results of our analysis can be viewed on the Carolina Across 100 website.",
